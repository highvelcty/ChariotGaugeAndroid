Chariot Gauge brings engine tuning analysis to automotive enthusiasts while eliminating the hassle of expensive physical gauges. The system displays digital and analog readouts of five essential sensors on a naturally aspirated or forced induction engine. The five sensors are \
* Wideband Oxygen\
* 2.5bar Manifold Air Pressure(boost/vac)\
* Oil Pressure\
* Intake Air or Coolant Temp. \
* and Voltmeter\
\
Chariot Gauge is widely configurable for different IAT/CLT sensors, Wideband, and Oil Pressure sensors. The MAP (MPX4250AP) is soldered directly to the PCB board, future updates will allow for different sensors to be soldered in. Chariot Gauge is OBD agnostic and will work in virtually any automotive application and is ideal for Pre OBD-II vehicles.\
